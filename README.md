## Configure environment

You need to configure your environment variables now. Copy `config.env.example` and rename as `config.env`. Now provide values for the keys mentioned there.


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ nvm use
$ yarn install

A small tweak is needed to be done after you finish installing the dependencies.
